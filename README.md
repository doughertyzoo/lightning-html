Small project representing a 60-minute effort at matching a previously-unseen fully-fleshed-out PSD. Started from scratch, with a Bootstrap base. Stopped development at precisely 60-minutes (using a timer). End result is index.html off the root, and supporting .css file (and .js, but that was not relevant in the end).

Repository includes all working files, including my development setup, leveraging gulp watch and lite-server.
